* search / jump / goto content                              :emacs:org:occur:
description of several ways of finding contents in emacs:
- in main files: 
  - treat most important files as org-agenda-files
  - look for content in body of header with TAGS:
    - C-c a s (org-search-view): +:TAG1 :TAG2 CONTENT
      - requirement: header must have TAG itself -> inheritance not
        allowed
    - C-c a s: CONTENT, with TAG-restrictions applied afterwards
      - enable filtering with "/"
    - restricted search on subtree:
      - find subtree via org-refile: C-u C-c C-w
      - restrict search: C-c a <
      - press s for search
  - C-c a s: search regexp in all agenda files plus additional search
    files, show superior header as search results
  - C-c a /: search regexp in all agenda files, show exact lines of
    occurrences
- generally in multiple files:
  - multi-occur: show regexp search in chosen files
    - C-c C-f: enable next-error-follow-mode
    - goto next error: C-t n
- search for tags and properties in multiple files:
  - C-c a m: org-tags-view
- search for tags and properties in current file:
  - C-c / m: org-match-sparse-tree
