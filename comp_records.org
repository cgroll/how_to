#+TITLE: Records on how to efficiently use the computer

* Structure

- divided according to thematic subjects
- main header for thematic subject shall entail uppercase SECTION,
  which can be easily identified in search lists
- each emacs-related thematic section shall have a subheader with
  keyword SHORTCUTS where important emacs shortcuts are stored 
- external shortcut reference-cards shall be linked to in oracle
- at best, each sub-header should contain thematic header tags as
  well, in order to enable searching text bodies of headlines with
  given TAG in header: e.g., search all "R" and "ESS" tagged
  headlines for regexp "*hist*" (to find get.hist.quote)
- if sub-headers fail to entail tags, then searching in related
  subtree could be achieved by
  - follow refile targets (C-u C-x C-w) to related subtree
  - perform subtree-restricted search
* bookmark SECTION                                           :bookmark:emacs:
- bookmarks are stored in ~/.emacs.bmk -> synced via Dropbox through
  symbolic link
- bookmarks are shown at start-up
- bookmarks can be extended with recently open files with 'recentf-open-files
